# Android AR Pokemon Demo
### Using: SceneView (Google ARCore + Filament SDK) + Simple Blender Rigging and Animation
Just a small demo of some basic animations I made in Blender animating on top of a psyduck pokemon card. I'd like to add more but time and complexity are limiting me right now >_<

### How to use
Build it and point the camera at the pokemon card in the assets folder, there'll be a button to change the current animation to an attack animation.
